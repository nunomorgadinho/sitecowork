//$window-width : 1000px; // I use this when I have a conainer that needs a background or something like that and it's larger than the page layout
//$layout-width : $blueprint-container-size; // a more functional variable.


// I usually use a vertical grid with vertical rhythm for typographic

$vr: 6;           // vertical rhythm. I usually use multiples of 6 for line-height in my layouts
$mb: (3 * $vr);   // general margin-bottom for containers. this maintains consistency and vertical rhythm throughout the layout
